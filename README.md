# Call API with Suspense & VueJS 3 ðŸ“¡

This use case of Suspense's build-in feature of VueJS 3 is created using [ViteJS](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) (light framework to build VueJS apps without webpack)

## Init project

    git clone https://github.com/VincentLrg/SuspenseVue3.git
    npm i (or yarn install)
    npm run dev (or yarn dev)

### Warning âš ï¸Ž
If you aren't familiar with VueJS 3 new concepts and Composition API, you should definitely check the official VueJS documentation [here](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

This repository shows you how to make an asynchronous API call with Vue JS 3 & the Suspense built-in feature, and how to make it reusable across your app.

## How Does Suspense work ?

First, Suspense should be declare in a Parent component, with a #default template (which will have a slot for the component you wanted to show) and a #fallback template, which will have the html that will be displayed when you load the data.

It will take the child component that is referred in the #default template, and, while all promises in it are pending, we will display the #fallback template. After all the promises are resolved, Vue will switch reactively to display the content of the #default template.

### Error catcher
In the parent component, there is an error catcher using the new hook `onErrorCaptured` and a reactive variable. With a simple `v-if/v-else`, we check if we need to display the error message if an error is thrown everywhere in the app, or the Suspense component if we don't have any error.
You can simply copy/paste it, and it's the best practice for now !
